## Introduction

Cyclistic is a bike-share program operating in Chicago, providing diverse bicycles and docking stations. This project aims to explore distinct usage patterns between annual members and casual riders.

The program is operating in Chicago with over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations, offering three types of bikes: **Docked, Electrical, and Classic.**.

The marketing goal is to convert casual riders into annual riders. In order to achieve this, the marketing team needs a better understanding of how annual members and casual riders differ. 

## User Demographics
Cyclistic ridership comprises members and casual users. In the second semester of 2023, 60% are members, while casual users show a slight increase in summer.
```{r, results='asis'}
ggplot(totalaverage, aes(x = day_of_week, y = averagebytrip, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(averagebytrip, 2)), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5) +
  labs(title = "Average Trip Duration for Members by Day of Week",
       x = NULL,
       y = "Average Trip Duration (minutes)",
       fill= NULL)+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 9), axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45))
